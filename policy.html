        <div class="terms">
        <h4>1. General
        </h4>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. Where processing is based on consent and to the extent permitted by law, by agreeing to these Terms, you consent to SexxyTube collection, use and disclosure of Your Content and Data.</p>
            <p>SexxyTube ('we', 'us' or 'ours') are the controller of your personal information, and we are obligated to protect and respect your privacy and your personal integrity, when you use our products and services and are browsing the website. We ask you to read this Privacy Policy carefully and familiarize yourself with the content. </p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains the ways in which we may collect, process, use and, in certain circumstances, disclose your Personal Data in accordance with all applicable laws. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us. If you have any questions, the data protection department can be reached by e-mail at support@sexxytube.com. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, then do not use the services supplied via the Internet, the Sites or the mobile entertainment and information short messaging services (collectively referred to as the "Services''). Responsible body and data protection officer is represented by the management of SexxyTube. </p>
         <h4>2. Adults only</h4>
            <p>Neither the Services nor the Sites are intended for use by minors. Only 18+ people have the right to access any of the data provided on our website. We will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information submitted by minors. Upon notification of our collection of personal data of a minor without parental consent, we will promptly delete such information.
            </p>
            <h4>3. What personal data are and where we get them from?
            </h4>
            <p>“Personal data” are all information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as “person concerned”); a natural person is deemed to be identifiable if they can directly or indirectly be identified by name, phone number, user agent etc.</p>
            <p>a) Data that is produced when the website is visited. You can view our websites without entering any personal data. As a rule, we only store the website from which you accessed our website, the name of your internet service provider, which websites you visited within our website and the date and duration of your visit. In order to do this, small files (known as cookies) are stored in your computer’s memory for the duration of your visit. These are what are known as temporary session cookies (for more information on permanent cookies see section 10 below). The relevant data are stored on the servers of our service provider LeaseWeb Global B.V. Luttenbergweg 8, 1101 EC Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The session cookies are automatically deleted as soon as you close your browser window. We use the session cookies to create what is known as a session ID for internal statistical purposes. The data obtained are fully anonymised, so there is no chance of you being identified as a person. Your IP address and a time stamp are stored for security reasons and only used for internal purposes. The IP address is a machine-related identification that enables a conclusion to be drawn about the computer used to access the internet or the internet gateway used at the time of the online inquiry. The term time stamp means a value in a defined format that allocates a time to an event (such as the sending or receiving of a message or the modification of data or the like). The purpose of a time stamp is to make clear to people or computers when events occurred.
            </p>
            <p>We also use cookies to record the statistical frequency with which the various pages of our website are accessed and the general navigation. If, however, you want to prevent the use of cookies, you can use your browser to prevent the acceptance and storage of new cookies. You can still use our website if you do this, but there may be a restriction in the scope of service. To find out how this works in the browser you use, please use the help function in your browser or contact the manufacturer. However, we recommend leaving cookies switched on as this is the only way that we can deliver the high level of user comfort we are always striving to achieve.</p>
            <p>b) Personal data that you send to us in a form. We obtain your personal data when you enter these data in a registration or contact form on our website, thereby registering for value added services / information and multimedia services. The data that are collected depend on which specific service you are interested in. Unless otherwise included on the respective form, the following data are collected and stored: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>your telephone number, </li>
                <li>your geographical location (country). </li>
                <li>if you have granted consent for advertising when you registered, we will also store your registration data (date and time of declaration of consent, IP address, your browser and operating system details, device).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>c) Personal data that you send to us by pointing your interest. Once you are registering for the value added services / information and multimedia services, we may ask you further questions that you can answer (but do not have to answer). These questions ask about general preferences and interests (e.g. industry). If you answer these questions, we will also store these answers so we and our sponsors can send you advertisements appropriate to your interests. The data are, however, only stored and passed on to the sponsors if you have granted consent for advertising.</p>
            <h4>4. Purposes for which we use your personal data</h4>
            <p>According to the GDPR, the Federal Data Protection Act and other laws that regulate data protection, we can only process your personal data with your legal consent. </p>
            <p>a) Processing for the fulfilment of contractual obligations (Article 6 paragraph 1 b) GDPR): we primarily use and collect your personal data to run the value added services / information and multimedia services. However, some of your data are also collected for advertising purposes: if you participate in the value added services / information and multimedia services (which is funded by advertising) via the online form and grant consent for advertising at the same time, the subject matter of the value added services / information and multimedia contract concluded also includes the transfer of data for promotional purposes. In this case, your contractual consideration is that you grant consent for advertising which enables us and our sponsors to provide advertising in the areas mentioned (post, email and telephone advertising). For this reason, the data are stored in accordance with Article 6 1 b) GDPR and used by us for advertising purposes. The data are then also passed on to the sponsors to provide advertising in the areas mentioned. If you terminate the value added services / information and multimedia contract, we will then refrain from continuing to use these data for advertising purposes. If you conclude a value added services / information and multimedia contract without obligation on your part to grant consent for advertising, the above-mentioned use of the data for advertising purposes will not apply.</p>
            <p>b) Processing on the basis of your consent (Article 6 paragraph 1 a) GDPR: we also process your data on the basis of consent for advertising if you grant us this consent when registering for the providing value added services / information and multimedia services. In this case, we use the data ourselves for advertising purposes and forward it to our sponsors within the scope of the consent you granted.</p>
            <p>c) Processing to protect legitimate interests (Article 6 paragraph 1 1 f) GDPR): if you answer questions after/during registering for the value added services / information and multimedia services which do not refer to a specific product, we will store your answers with your personal data to ensure targeted advertising. In the case of answers which do refer to a specific product, we will forward your answer to the relevant company.</p>
            <p>d) Processing on the basis of legal requirements (Article 6 paragraph 1 c) GDPR): finally, we process your data to meet our fiscal and commercial accounting and record keeping obligations.</p>
            <h4>5. Where do we process your personal information?
            </h4>
            <p>The personal data we collect from you can be transferred to and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), including destinations not covered by a decision of the European Commission on an adequate level of protection for the processing of personal data. It can be shared with other companies within the SexxyTube.com, handled by employees working for us or for one of our suppliers outside the EEA. Such staff may, for example, be involved in fulfilling your order, processing your payment information and performing our support services. We take all reasonable precautions to ensure that your personal information is processed safely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and has taken appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information. For further information about or a copy of these safeguards, please contact us using the contact information found at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h4>6. How long do we store your personal data?</h4>
            <p>We will keep your personal information only as long as we consider it necessary to fulfill our purposes as described above. Then we will delete or, in some cases, anonymize your personal information. Since we process your personal information for different purposes, the actual period of personal information will vary. Typically, the following deletion deadlines apply:</p>

            </h4>

                <li>to request that we correct incorrect personal data concerning you immediately. Taking into account the purpose of the processing you also have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data, including by means of a supplementary declaration (Article 16 GDPR: right to rectification), </li>
                <li>to request that we delete personal data concerning you immediately (Article 17 GDPR: right of deletion), </li>
                <li>to request that we restrict processing (Article 18 GDPR: right to restriction of processing), </li>
                <li>in the event of processing based on consent or for performance of a contract, to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit these data to another responsible without hindrance from us or to transmit these data directly to another responsible person where this is technically feasible (Article 20 GDPR: right to data portability), - to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time, to the processing of personal data that is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or the exercise of official authority (Article 21 GDPR: right to object), </li>
                <li>to lodge a complaint at any time with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, their workplace or the place of the alleged infringement if you are of the opinion that the processing of the personal data concerning you infringes applicable law (Article 77 GDPR in combination with Section 19 of the Federal Data Protection Act: right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority).</li>
            </ul>
                <p>If you have granted us consent, you ultimately have the right to revoke your consent at any time. In this case, all data processing carried out by us up to the point at which you revoked your consent remains legal.

            <p>We use technical and organisational security measures to ensure that your personal data are protected against loss, incorrect modifications and unauthorised access by third parties. In any case, from our side it is only authorised persons who have access to your personal data, and they only have this to the extent required for the above-mentioned purposes. The security measures are constantly being adapted to the improvements in technical possibilities.</p>
            <h4>9. How we disclose your personal data</h4>
            <ul>We will not disclose your Personal Data to any third party unless:

                <li>such disclosure is required by law or by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or in case we have the good-faith believe that disclosure is necessary in order to protect or defend the rights or property of us; </li>
                <li>such disclosure is necessary for service providers retained by us to perform functions on its behalf or to provide services to us, such as advertising, promotion and fulfillment services, market research, auditing, website administration, data processing, information technology and office services, provided such organization or individual does not collect, use or disclose the Personal Data for any purpose other than to perform such functions or provide services to us; </li>
                <li>Personal Data is included in a transaction for the sale or securitization of some or all of our assets solely for the purpose of facilitating and effecting such transaction.
